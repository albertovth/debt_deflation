You can use this app to model and visualize [debt deflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_deflation), in general terms for an economy. Debt deflation is understood as the process through which total debt decreases in the economy, leading to deflationary effects on growth, prices, employment, and wages. 

This model offers a simplified and discrete approach to more complex models, like Steve Keen's (2011) [monetary Minsky model](https://keenomics.s3.amazonaws.com/debtdeflation_media/papers/PaperPrePublicationProof.pdf), which is based on differential equations. In this model, the differential equations are replaced by growth rates calculated on macroeconomic variables. The result is a less smooth visualization, but one that can be easier to grasp intuitively.

The app includes a series of sliders to adjust various preset parameters. Most of the presets are calibrated to regressions for the Norwegian economy, using the latest available data. However, this does not apply to the variable called **threshold_periods_for_financial_collapse**. This variable is exogenous to the other variables in the model, and can be adjusted to simulate different scenarios.

The number of periods leading to financial collapse is difficult to predict, and it is uncertain whether a collapse will occur within the analyzed period. This depends on several factors, including financial fragility, diminishing returns on debt, debt servicing costs, and confidence. Establishing an estimate for **threshold_periods_for_financial_collapse** should be done on the basis of careful analysis of financial conditions in each individual economy, based on research like performed by [Irving Fisher (1933)](https://doi.org/10.2307/1907327), [Steve Keen (2001)](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/debunking-economics-9781848139954/), [Hyman Minsky (1986)](https://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/stabilizing-an-unstable-economy), central banks and projects on economic downturns.
It is important to add as a disclaimer that there is no model that can with complete accuracy predict financial shocks and debt deflation. This is because of the inherent complexity of the processes involved, ranging from structural economic relations to psychological aspects of economies. The purpose of this simple illustration is therefore not to predict, but to simplify and illustrate complex ideas graphically.
